Nest multiple blocks inside lists of any kind of list (ordered, unordered, no marker, etc), or do away with list markers and use it like a repeater!

== Description ==

A handy little block that can be used in a variety of ways. Use it to nest other blocks inside list items, to create simple grid layouts ( like a properly responsive pricing table, or a wrapping icon list), or other use cases I haven't yet thought of!



== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly, or search for `Super List Block` in the Block Library.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress if installed manually or through the WordPress plugins screen.
3. Use the `Super List` block in the Block Editor
