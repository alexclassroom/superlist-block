![Super List Block](https://github.com/createwithrani/superlist/blob/main/assets/banner-1544x500.png)

Nest multiple blocks inside lists of any kind of list (ordered, unordered, no marker, etc), or do away with list markers and use it like a repeater!

## Description

A handy little block that can be used in a variety of ways. Use it to nest other blocks inside list items, to create simple grid layouts ( like a properly responsive pricing table, or a wrapping icon list), or other use cases I haven't yet thought of!

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.9+
- PHP 7.0+
